                <TextParagraph>The PiS is in an awkward position. Less than a year after its election victory, its

                    The OECD writes: "<i>Public trust is the bedrock of democracy and sound public governance.</i>"
                    However, a
                    functioning democracy is no guarantee of a high level of trust. On the contrary, freedom of
                    expression allows citizens to express their mistrust, unlike in authoritarian states. And yet, a
                    comparison with the Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index shows that countries with a better
                    democracy score also have better trust ratings.

                    Many things can be bought, even in politics. However, the OECD data shows that trust is not so easy
                    to come by. It seems that it cannot be gained overnight with a few popular measures. And it is
                    easily destroyed again - by briefcases full of money to venal members of parliament or global
                    economic crises.
                </TextParagraph>
                <TextParagraph>
                    Rather, trust grows through small measures, through a long process over several governments. The
                    data also shows that this is possible. And it is necessary according to the OECD. Trust is essential
                    to tackle the major challenges of our time, such as climate change, labour market issues and an
                    ageing society.
