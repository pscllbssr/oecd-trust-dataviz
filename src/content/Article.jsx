                    showed 22.6Â° degrees, the air is slowly cooling down. Quite a few Poles are probably drawn indoors,
                    some of them switch on the television. And those who watch the private news channel TVN24 witness a

                <TextParagraph>Images from a hidden camera flicker across the screens in Polish parlours. They show Adam
                    Lipinski from the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) trying to persuade MP Renata Berger
                    (Samoobrona) to join his party. He offers her posts and money in return. </TextParagraph>
                <TextParagraph>The PiS is in an awkward position. Less than a year after its election victory, its
                    governing coalition with Samoobrona has collapsed. Because other parties are refusing to co-operate,
                    the PiS is trying to persuade MPs to defect in order to remain in power.</TextParagraph>

                    government. This is the lowest figure in the OECD's data set on trust in national

                <TextParagraph>How well countries fare in this ranking depends on various factors. On the one hand,
                    corruption plays a major role, as in the polish example above. But also the wider cultural
                    and economic context when it comes to trust in the government and institutions.</TextParagraph>
                <TextParagraph>The data set also contains a correspondingly large number of regional similarities. In
                    Asia, for example, there is a steady increase, similar to Eastern Europe. In Latin America and
                    Southern Europe, both hit hard by the 2008 financial crisis, confidence fell steadily and is only
                    slowly recovering. </TextParagraph>

                <TextParagraph>
                    The OECD writes: "<i>Public trust is the bedrock of democracy and sound public governance.</i>"
                    However, a
                    functioning democracy is no guarantee of a high level of trust. On the contrary, freedom of
                    expression allows citizens to express their mistrust, unlike in authoritarian states. And yet, a
                    comparison with the Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index shows that countries with a better
                    democracy score also have better trust ratings.
                </TextParagraph>
                <ChapterTitle>More democracy is associated with higher trust</ChapterTitle>

                <TextParagraph>
                    Many things can be bought, even in politics. However, the OECD data shows that trust is not so easy
                    to come by. It seems that it cannot be gained overnight with a few popular measures. And it is
                    easily destroyed again - by briefcases full of money to venal members of parliament or global
                    economic crises.
                </TextParagraph>
                <TextParagraph>
                    Rather, trust grows through small measures, through a long process over several governments. The
                    data also shows that this is possible. And it is necessary according to the OECD. Trust is essential
                    to tackle the major challenges of our time, such as climate change, labour market issues and an
                    ageing society.
